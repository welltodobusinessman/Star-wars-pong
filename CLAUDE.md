# Claude Instructions for everygame Repository

## Workflow Rules
- **Always commit and push changes to GitHub** after making any modifications to game files
- **Use descriptive commit messages** following the format: "Add [feature]" or "Fix [issue]" or "Update [component]"
- **Test functionality** before committing changes
- **Include co-author attribution** in commit messages

## Project Structure
- HTML games stored in root directory
- Each game should be self-contained in a single HTML file
- Games should be mobile-responsive and include touch controls where applicable

## Commit Guidelines
### Format
```
[Action] [component/feature]: [brief description]

[Optional detailed description]

### Examples
- "Add mobile touch controls: Enable paddle dragging for Star Wars Pong"
- "Fix collision detection: Improve ball-paddle physics"
- "Update game UI: Add responsive design for mobile devices"

## Quality Standards
- All games must work on both desktop and mobile devices
- Code should be well-commented and readable
- Games should include proper error handling
- Mobile touch controls should be intuitive and responsive

## Automatic Push Policy
When Claude makes changes to any game file:
1. Add all changes to git staging
2. Create a descriptive commit message
3. Push immediately to the main branch
4. Confirm successful push to GitHub

This ensures the repository stays synchronized with all improvements and changes.
