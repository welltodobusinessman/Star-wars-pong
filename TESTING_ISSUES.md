# Testing Issues and Solutions

## Overview
This document outlines the testing problems encountered during the development of Star Wars Pong and their solutions.

## Critical Testing Issues

### 1. Browser Dependencies Missing
**Problem**: Playwright tests fail due to missing system dependencies
```
Error: browserType.launch: 
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers. ║
║ Please install them with the following command:      ║
║                                                      ║
║     sudo npx playwright install-deps                 ║
║                                                      ║
║ Alternatively, use apt:                              ║
║     sudo apt-get install libnspr4\                   ║
║         libnss3\                                     ║
║         libasound2t64                                ║
║                                                      ║

**Impact**: All 75 tests fail to execute
**Status**: ❌ Unresolved - requires system-level dependency installation

**Solution**: 
1. Install required dependencies: `sudo npx playwright install-deps`
2. Or manually install: `sudo apt-get install libnspr4 libnss3 libasound2t64`
3. Alternative: Use Docker container with pre-installed dependencies

### 2. Test Timeout Issues
**Problem**: Tests timing out after 2 minutes
**Impact**: CI/CD pipeline may fail due to long execution times
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs optimization

**Solution**:
- Reduce test timeout from 30s to 15s for faster feedback
- Optimize test scenarios to reduce waiting periods
- Use more efficient selectors and assertions

### 3. Mobile Audio Testing Gaps
**Problem**: Audio context creation tests exist but mobile-specific audio issues not covered
**Impact**: Mobile audio problems go undetected in automated testing
**Status**: ❌ Missing coverage

**Solution**:
- Add mobile-specific audio tests
- Test autoplay policy compliance
- Verify touch-to-play audio initialization

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Current Test Coverage (75 tests total)
- ✅ **Game Loading**: 5 tests
- ✅ **Navigation**: 3 tests  
- ✅ **Gameplay**: 8 tests
- ✅ **Controls**: 6 tests (keyboard + touch)
- ✅ **Audio**: 2 tests
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: 4 tests
- ✅ **Performance**: 2 tests
- ✅ **Error Handling**: 3 tests
- ✅ **State Management**: 2 tests

### Missing Test Coverage
- ❌ Mobile audio autoplay policies
- ❌ FPS performance monitoring
- ❌ Network connectivity issues
- ❌ Battery optimization scenarios
- ❌ Accessibility features
- ❌ Cross-browser audio compatibility

## CI/CD Pipeline Issues

### GitHub Actions Workflow
**Current Status**: ✅ Properly configured
- Runs on push/PR to main/master branches
- Tests before deployment
- Auto-deploys to GitHub Pages

**Potential Issues**:
1. **Dependency Installation**: May fail in CI environment without proper setup
2. **Test Parallelization**: 16 workers may overwhelm CI resources
3. **Artifact Upload**: Coverage directory may not exist

## Recommendations

### Short-term Fixes
1. **Reduce Test Parallelization**: Use single worker in CI (`workers: 1`)
2. **Add Dependency Check**: Verify browser deps before test execution
3. **Implement Graceful Fallbacks**: Continue with subset of tests if browsers unavailable

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Docker Integration**: Use containerized testing environment
2. **Mobile Device Farm**: Test on real mobile devices
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add automated FPS and load time tracking
4. **Audio Testing Suite**: Comprehensive mobile audio compatibility tests

### Code Quality Enhancements
1. **Error Boundaries**: Better error handling in game code
2. **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging
3. **Metrics**: Built-in performance monitoring

## Test Environment Requirements

### Development Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers (requires system deps)
npx playwright install

# Run tests
npm test
```

### CI Environment Setup
```yaml
- name: Install system dependencies
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y libnspr4 libnss3 libasound2t64

- name: Install Playwright
  run: |
    npm install
    npx playwright install
```

### Docker Alternative
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-focal
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "test"]
```

## Known Mobile Issues

### Audio Problems
1. **Autoplay Policy**: Mobile browsers block audio without user interaction
2. **Audio Context**: Requires user gesture to create/resume
3. **Web Audio API**: Limited support on older mobile browsers
4. **Performance**: Audio processing can impact frame rate

### Solutions Implemented
- Touch-to-play audio initialization
- Graceful audio fallbacks
- Performance-optimized audio generation

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Load Time**: < 3 seconds (currently tested)
- **Frame Rate**: > 30 FPS (currently tested)
- **Memory Usage**: Not currently monitored
- **Audio Latency**: Not currently measured

### Recommended Additions
- Real-time FPS counter (in development)
- Memory usage tracking
- Audio latency measurement
- Network performance monitoring
