## Game Logic Issues Found During Manual Testing

### 4. Ball Collision Physics Problems
**Problem**: Ball could get stuck in collision loops with paddles
**Impact**: Gameplay breaks, ball bounces rapidly between paddle and its previous position
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Root Cause**: 
- Ball collision detection didn't check if ball was already moving away from paddle
- Insufficient clearance when moving ball away from paddle after collision

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Added direction checks to prevent double bounces
if (paddle.isPlayer1 && this.vx > 0) return false; // Ball moving away from player 1
if (!paddle.isPlayer1 && this.vx < 0) return false; // Ball moving away from player 2

// Increased clearance distance from 1px to 2px
this.x = paddle.x + paddle.width + 2; // Player 1 paddle
this.x = paddle.x - this.size - 2;    // Player 2 paddle
```

### 5. Wall Collision Edge Cases
**Problem**: Ball could get stuck at walls or pass through them in edge cases
**Impact**: Ball behavior becomes unpredictable near screen boundaries
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Root Cause**: Simple velocity negation without position correction

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Before: this.vy = -this.vy;
// After: Proper position correction and direction enforcement
if (this.y <= 0) {
    this.y = 0;
    this.vy = Math.abs(this.vy); // Ensure ball moves down
} else if (this.y + this.size >= canvas.height) {
    this.y = canvas.height - this.size;
    this.vy = -Math.abs(this.vy); // Ensure ball moves up
}
```

### 6. AI Prediction Division by Zero
**Problem**: AI prediction could cause division by zero when ball velocity is 0
**Impact**: AI behavior becomes erratic, potential NaN values in calculations
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Root Cause**: No validation of ball.vx before division in time calculation

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Added safety checks and time limits
if (gameDifficulty !== 'easy' && ball.vx > 0 && ball.vx !== 0) {
    const timeToReach = (this.x - ball.x) / ball.vx;
    if (timeToReach > 0 && timeToReach < 5) { // Reasonable time limit
        // Prediction logic with wall bounce handling
    }
}
```

### 7. Touch Controls Menu Interference
**Problem**: Touch controls for paddles interfered with menu navigation
**Impact**: Users couldn't properly navigate menus on mobile devices
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Root Cause**: Touch event handlers were active even when game menus were visible

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Added menu state checks to touch handlers
if (!gameRunning || gamePaused || !document.getElementById('gameMenu').classList.contains('hidden')) return;
```

### 8. Mobile Speech Test Button Positioning
**Problem**: Speech test button was hard to tap on mobile devices
**Impact**: Users couldn't test speech synthesis functionality
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Improvements Made**:
- Moved button to bottom center of screen for better accessibility
- Added minimum touch target size (44px height)
- Implemented visual feedback on touch
- Added proper touch event handling
- Button disappears during gameplay to avoid interference

### 9. Hit Position Calculation Overflow
**Problem**: Ball hit position calculation could exceed valid range
**Impact**: Unrealistic ball physics, extreme angles
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Added clamping to hit position calculation
const hitPos = ((this.y + this.size/2) - (paddle.y + paddle.height/2)) / (paddle.height/2);
const angle = Math.max(-1, Math.min(1, hitPos)) * Math.PI/4; // Clamp to [-1, 1]
```

## Performance Issues Identified

### 10. Unlimited FPS Implementation
**Problem**: FPS was capped at 240 by browser limitations
**Impact**: Users with high refresh rate displays couldn't utilize full performance
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Solution**: Implemented multiple rendering modes:
- **HYBRID**: setTimeout + requestAnimationFrame for maximum performance
- **TIMEOUT**: Pure setTimeout(0) for unlimited FPS
- **IMMEDIATE**: setImmediate polyfill for fastest possible rendering
- **RAF**: Standard requestAnimationFrame (V-Sync capped)

### 11. FPS Counter Usability
**Problem**: FPS counter was hidden and hard to access
**Impact**: Users couldn't monitor performance
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Improvements**:
- Always visible FPS button in top-right corner
- F key shortcut for quick toggle
- U key to cycle between FPS modes
- Color-coded performance indicators
- Mobile-optimized touch targets
